		The data analysis software used by Prometheus is a revolutionary way to compare associations and trends in the workplace. The software analyzes and breaks down all forms of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine outcomes, prioritize issues and fix them, and most importantly recognize common occurences and possible trends in the system. Data is stored using binary by the action of the computer knowingn certain functions. These functions can be made binary by asking the computer if they are happening or not. For example, this could be used in multiple ways. Say you want to recognize trends in the stock market, or even create a predictive model for company types that may succeed, or even predict the outcome of a baseball game. But these are things that are much larger when realistically we are measuring if the outcome of a pitch is a strike or not. We can then extrapolate what comes up from the data, letâ€™s a difference in arm angle on the pitch, to find the issues and immediately fix them

			 Cogintion: People have already been able to program basic problem solving abilities, some examples of which would be video game CPUs and chess-playing robots. In those cases, the system can collect data, be it from a system or human input, and then respond with an action. Prometheus takes that to the next level by storing vast quantities of information and utilizing Deep Learning to imitate a learning process

			Neural Networks: The three main Deep Neural Networks in say, self driving cars are the Detection and Classification Network, the Segmentation Network and the End to End Network. This Detection and Classification Network is used for object detection and lane marking. The Segmentation Network is used for maintaining the free space around the vehicle and the End to End Networks are used to mimic learned driver behavior.
