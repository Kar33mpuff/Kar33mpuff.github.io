					<h3>Foundations of Engineering</h3>
					Students learn the steps of the technological process. Using these steps, the students design and build projects that are assigned. This class starts at the beginning, drafting, and works its way down the engineering process, all the way to production methods, like 3D printing and CNC.

					<h3>Innovation and Invention Robotics</h3>
					Students learn to program and build robots that compete in interscholastic events. These events, normally designed by the tech ed teacher, will create a fun learning environment for aspiring technology students. This class puts power in the hands of the students, to build a robot to solve an open ended chalenge

					<h3>Comp-Sci</h3>
					Students learn the basics of coding and computer design. Often projects will include basic website creation, or coding for a number output as practice. Students in the lower compsci classes will start with drag and drop programming, wheras the AP compsci courses immediately delve into JavaScript and Python.
