  	<h3>That machine learning thing...how does it work?</h3>
  	<p>
  		Lets look at it through the lens of self driving cars: The cars use something called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is the car’s ability to learn new information about its environment without directly being programmed. This is a necesity in self driving vehicles and the future of AI because some behaviours of other drivers and unpredictable elements of the environment are to complicated and long to program into a vehicle. There is too much observation and the AI must self teach itself instead. Deep Learning uses many complex algorithms that work with different recognitions such as the Image and Sound recognition. The term “Deep” in Deep Learning refers to the amount of the neuronal networks in the AI. Mathematical observations from the environment are then put through these networks. A larger amount of networks results in more data collected for the AI to use. 
	</p>
	<h3>So what does it do?</h3>
	<p>
		The three main Deep Neural Networks in self-driving vehicles are the Detection and Classification Network, the Segmentation Network and the End to End Network. This Detection and Classification Network is used for object detection and lane marking. The Segmentation Network is used for maintaining the free space around the vehicle and the End to End Networks are used to mimic learned driver behavior.
	</p>
	<h3>Wait...does this mean I never have to drive to work again?</h3>
	<p>
		No. Not too fast. Self driving cars have some issues too. AI in cars uses tons of computing and lots of data needs to be collected. This can be very difficult if there is an slight error in the computing which could cause a major safety issue on the road. Furthermore, since the margins for error are so small, if there is any lag in the system, there could be even more issues. Lastly, adding to the smallness of the margins, the data from the environment needs to be interpreted on board while the action is happening. However, within the next few decades, these problems will likely be solved, and then yes, you will probably never drive to work again.
