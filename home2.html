  	<h3>A Tool That Learns</h3>
  	<p>
  		Lets look at it through the lens of self driving cars: The cars use something called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is the car’s ability to learn new information about its environment without directly being programmed. This is a necesity in self driving vehicles and the future of AI because some behaviours of other drivers and unpredictable elements of the environment are to complicated and long to program into a vehicle. There is too much observation and the AI must self teach itself instead. Deep Learning uses many complex algorithms that work with different recognitions such as the Image and Sound recognition. The term “Deep” in Deep Learning refers to the amount of the neuronal networks in the AI. Mathematical observations from the environment are then put through these networks. A larger amount of networks results in more data collected for the AI to use.  Prometheus thus utilizes deep learning to make itself more efficient over time, thus making its optimization more optimized.

  	<h3>That machine learning thing...how does it work?</h3>
  	<p>
  		The goal of Prometheus, like any other AI is to fundamentally recreate cognitive abilities in technology, but what this means is rather complicated. Prometheus responds to stimuli in a way that we as humans would characterize as intelligent, however, these processes can be relatively simple or extremely complex depending on the desired capabilities. Much in the way that living creatures are, AI can only do what it’s programmed to do. it is possible to program basic problem solving abilities, some examples of which would be video game CPUs and chess-playing robots. In those cases, the system can collect data, be it from a system or human input, and then respond with an action.

				Prometheus allows for software optimization by tracking which products demand the greatest and least use.  Thus, it can read an ever changing market to allow developers to bring to market fresh, trendy products.

				By analyzing vast team metrics in conjunction with the typical player metrics, Prometheus can examine the circumstantial value of given athletes at a given time and assess their synergistic value to the team.

				Prometheus can improve automotive development by running complex simulations.  For example, it can use scrubbed data to evaluate the effect of a greatly altered drivetrain (eg. electric) and weight dynamics on a conventional suspension.
